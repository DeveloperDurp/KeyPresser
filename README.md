# KeyPresser

##### Version: 1.0.4 

## How to use 

1. Click green "Code" button and then click download ZIP
2. Once downloaded extract anywhere (Inside the SRO directory is the most simple)
3. To run all you need to do is right click the Start.bat and click "Run as Administrator"


## Troubleshooting

If you find that keys are not pressed you can remove "sro_client" from the client section and it will start pressing keys no matter the application you use.
